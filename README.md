# MallettMap

This is a webmap developed to show Timmy Mallett's cycling route around GB and showcase the paintings he did along the way.

It was built using the OSSvelte branded webmap template (made by Josh Pooley in RPT) which has been forked to the CaTS project as [OSSvelteWebmap](https://ordnancesurvey.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/CaTS/_git/OSSvelteWebmap) for plug and play branded webmap development. For further information, refer to the readme.md in the OSSvelteWebmap repo.

## Dev Notes

To develop on localhost, run the following commands from the terminal:

- `npm install` (installs dependencies listed in package.json; will need to run this every time a new dependency is added)
- `npm run dev`
