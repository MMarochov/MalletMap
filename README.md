# MallettMap

This is a webmap developed to show Timmy Mallett's cycling route around GB and showcase the paintings he did along the way.

It was built using the OSSvelte branded webmap template (made by RPT) which has been forked to the CaTS project as [OSSvelteWebmap](https://ordnancesurvey.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/CaTS/_git/OSSvelteWebmap) for plug and play branded webmap development.
